```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse) ## loads package into the project
```
Tidyverse is great for data manipulation. 

### Exercise 1 
```{r}
d1 <- data.frame(name = c("Jake", "Abby", "Bailey", "Xavier"), 
                 age = c(11,20,19,5), 
                 male = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))

print(d1)
```

Use the dataframe `d1` and keep all the rows where `age` is <= 50. 

For this task we need to use `filter` from deployer. 

```{r}
d2 <- filter(d1, age <19)
d2
```
### Exercise 2 Use the data frame `d1` and remove all the rows where `age` is > 19 AND male is `false`

```{r}
d3 <- filter(d1, age > 19 | !male ) #filtering is keeping in never takes anything out so when the directions ask for remove, if using filter think of the inverse.
d3
```
### Exercise 3

From `d1` keep only the first two columns labeled `name` and `age`

```{r}
select(d1, name, age)
```
### Exercise 4
Extract all columns with names starting with `n`
```{r}
select(d1, starts_with("n")) ##all columns that start with n are selected
```
### Exercise 5
Extract all numeric columns
```{r}
select(d1, is.numeric) #base r function
```
### Exercise 6
Rename columns:  `name`as `first_name` and `age` as  `age_in_years`
```{r}
d1 <-rename(d1,first_name= name, age_in_years = age )
d1
```
